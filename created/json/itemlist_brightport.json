        "description":"In the year 57 of the rule of King luthor, the era of prosperity came to an end. Our king and hero, died. The lords, dukes, and nobles gathered in the capital of Fallhaven. To attend the funerary process of the king. At the time Fallhaven was a great city, extending it's reach much farther. Not long after, the nobility found themselves at an impasse, who would become the next ruler? King Luthor had left behind no known heir, and the opinions of the nobles shifted amongst themselves. One side pushed for Lord Erwin of House Garland as the new king, The ruler of Stoutford. Stoutford had long been the military center of the kingdom, experienced and hardened in their clashes with the uncivilized tribes of the western bogs and wildlands, as well as the occasional demonic incursions of Undertell. The warriors of Stoutford were a formidable force, the cornerstone of the kingdom's defense. Many nobles disagreed with House Garland ruling and instead favored Lord Emeric of House Houdart, the ruling house of Nor City which was the kingdom's historical capital and the center of culture and worship of the Shadow. The third faction rallied around Lord Geomyr of House Aumwill, the lord of Feygard and the former king's advisor. Lastly, a final faction was formed by the nobles of the central lands, who at first remained neutral, but fearing that a new king might threaten the status of Fallhaven as capital and shift it's importance away, chose to oppose the others. As discussions progressed, the four factions soon solidified into four coalitions. The Western Coalition, formed by Lord Erwin and his vassals, was centered around the town of Stoutford, along with it were the town of Prim and the settlement of Blackwater Mountain. The Central Coalition was formed by the various nobility and burghers of Crossglen, Loneford, Fallhaven, Vilegard, and Charwood. The Eastern Coalition was formed by the 3 great houses of Nor City with Lord Emeric of House Houdart in charge, along with other more minor nobility, especially those of Brimhaven and Brightport. And the clergy of Sullengard, who sought to return the king back to the historical center of Shadow worship. Lastly, the Northern Coalition, led by Lord Geomyr, was comprised of the city of Feygard, which housed the loathed cult of Elythara, as well as the mountain settlement of Thalgard and the town of Remgard. With this, the sides were set. As the discussions stalled, what was at first whispers turned to shouts of command. Lord Erwin rallied his troops to be the one first to move towards the central lands, the spies of the various factions rode their horses in a hurry to announce their overlords. By the time news reached the East, the Western troops were on the move. The western troops split in 3 and rallied in all directions. North, towards Loneford, south towards Sullengard, and northeast towards the capital. The 1st army had met no resistance taking Crossglen, and the occupation of the village was relatively peaceful until the end of the conflicts. In Fallhaven, the nobles, lacking central leadership, hurriedly mustered a militia force to man the palisades and resist the western coalition, having managed to do so just in time to offer resistance. Meanwhile, the 3rd army, moving south, struggled to cross the Sutdover River, delaying their advance on Sullengard. The houses of Nor City were caught off guard; no one had assumed the conflict would begin so soon after the discussions stalled. They rallied their troops, the bulk of their forces being comprised of commoners and numerous levies. The members of house Houdart led the army, with the trained knights of its branching houses forming the elite core of their forces. Orders were sent to the regional leadership, and the armies moved to meet with their allies. The 1st army was led by Lord Emeric of Imeria Houdart The 2nd army was led by Duke Vergas of Ryfarion Houdart, and the 3rd army was led by Baron Benzimos of Worgand Houdart. Ensuring the house of Houdart and it's branches would lead the Kingdom if they were to succeed. Lord Emeric moved his army towards Fallhaven right as the attack of the Western Coalition commenced, deceptive correspondence painted himself to the central nobles as reinforcements. Making the towns of Vilegard and Charwood join in with the eastern coalition. The second army merged with the troops of Brightport, while the third moved south to defend Sullengard. And so it commenced, the start of the First Noble War. The troops of the western coalition advanced to the crossroads fortification, capturing it with minor resistance. Scouts were sent south and north to gauge the other coalition's approach, as the bulk of the troops moved towards the defenseless Loneford. In the south, the Western forces had passed the river and were on the eastern bank, moving towards Sullengard. In the center, Stoutford's elite forces crushed the meager militia and forcefully assimilated the town guard into their ranks, just in time, as Lord Emeric and his troops approached from the east. The Battle of Fallhaven began. Bodies fell on each side. Stoutford's hardened elite barely held on against the numerous forces of Nor City. Fallhaven burned, its inhabitants forced to hide or flee. Its wealthier citizens had already escaped to Feygard, taking their possessions with them. In the south, the troops of the western coalition met with the forces of the eastern coalition, led by Baron Benzimos. The two armies clashed, and the Western Coalition was on its back foot. With their back against the river, they opted for a retreat. Hoping to form a defensive line at the bridge and defend Stoutford's southern flank. The leaders, whose names were lost to history, hastily pulled back, whilst suffering many casualties. the plan to capture Sullengard having failed. To the north, Stoutford's troops secured Loneford with ease. Scouts reported no movement from the northern coalition. Lord Emeric's central forces soon moved to contest the crossroads, leading to skirmishes along the Duleian Road. Meanwhile, the Eastern Coalition's army, led by Duke Vergas, wary of Feygard's movements, sent scouts north to assess the Northern Coalition's response as their forces moved to merge with Brimhaven's forces. This predicament continued for many years. Battles devolved into minor skirmishes as both coalitions avoided any decisive engagements, unwilling to risk the lives of their troops. Both sides camped outside the ever-burning ruins of Fallhaven. In the south, the Sutdover River became the dividing line, while in the north, skirmishes were taking place in the forest between Brimhaven and Loneford. The Northern Coalition having made no move. The prolonged stalemate created a false sense of security. The garrisons of the encampments set to protect the northern flanks of both coalitions steadily diminished as the main forces required reinforcements to replenish their ranks. An uneasy truce took hold, allowing each side time to recover for a decisive battle. The war exposed the strengths and weaknesses of both sides. The Eastern Coalition, backed by Nor City, wielded immense wealth and manpower but it was stretched thin, its forces spread too far apart. The Western Coalition could afford to fight the larger forces of the East due due to their position and their proximity to the coalition's center of power in Stoutford. Manpower being the only issue, but the West employed prisoners from the mines as footmen, with its elite group of warriors being able to turn a disadvantage of numbers into an equal fight. With this in mind, Lord Emeric devised a plan. He wanted to capture Fallhaven and secure the symbol of the king from the former king Luthor's grave. He would draw away Erwin's reinforcements in Fallhaven via an attack from the south and then attack the Western Coalition in Fallhaven. The period of the Second War commenced. The East reinforced its southern army led by Baron Benzimos, ordering him to attack the bridge and take it at all costs. This plan succeeded, leading to a panic in the center of the Western troops. The ruins of Fallhaven, now a smoldering ground far from its marble clad roads and opulent buildings. were contested by skirmishes nearly every day. The reinforcements from Stoutford and Blackwater allowed the Western coalition to hold its line, but the sudden advance from the south required that the supply of recruits was to focus on the Sutdover. Having moved according to the Eastern Coalition's plan, Lord Emeric rallied his troops. The Second Battle of Fallhaven commenced. Larger and more brutal than the first, having fought for months on end, both sides lost hundreds of troops. Lord Emeric's forces, having seemingly bested their enemies, started advancing towards the west. At that same time, the expected happened. The Third period of the Noble Wars started. The troops of Feygard suddenly moved south from Feygard and Falgard, crushing the minor garrisons set to defend against the north and moved to capture Loneford and Brimhaven. In Brimhaven, the leadership panicked and switched sides, leaving a portion of the Eastern troops led by Duke Vergas to follow Brimhaven in their rebellion and switch sides. The loyal to Nor City Vergas, fled along with the remaining of his troops to Brightport. Loneford was swiftly captured, and the advance of the northern coalition to Fallhaven was imminent. The Eastern Coalition was the first to disengage, with the forces of Baron Benzimos retreating to the stronghold of Sullengard. The remaining troops of Lord Emeric moved southeast on the Duleian. Lord Geomyr split his forces in two: one chased after Lord Emeric's army, while the other moved to capture the remains of Fallhaven. In Brightport, The Feygardian troops met the resistance hastily mounted by the remaining troops of Duke Vergas, and were successful in routing them, securing Brightport. Feygard captured Fallhaven and Crossglen, then moved toward Stoutford, where the western coalition prepared for a siege. Feygard's troops caught up to the fleeing troops of the Eastern coalition and dealt a devastating blow to the exhausted forces. Baron Benzimos left a small contingent to defend Sullengard and moved to assist his lord in the Battle of the now cursed forest. The Blackwater settlements were bribed to cut their support of the Western Coalition; their leaders were spared. The Feygardians, laid siege to Stoutford, capturing Lord Erwin and executing him, along with the surviving members of House Garland. The decisive battle between the troops of Feygard and the Eastern coalition, ended with Baron Benzimos recklessly charging into the ranks of armored Feygard knights. Leading to his demise. lord Emeric was killed by a stray arrow, and only a third of the troops returned to Nor City. House Welfort took control and signed a treaty with Feygard. Lord Geomyr was crowned king, marking the end of the war."
